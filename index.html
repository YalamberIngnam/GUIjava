        <div class="content"> One popular fruit around the globe is a fruit
             that comes in different sizes, shapes and colors. Which one were you thinking of? I was thinking of Apples. 
            Apples is such a common fruit, people take it for granted. 
            however have you ever wonder why one of the world's leading computer industries is named apple? 
            And it uses an image of a half-eaten, multi-colored apple as it's my main logo?
             Why do you give your teachers apples and not oranges? Why is apple so closely related to academics? 
             Would do you say " she's the apple of my eye" but not " she's the strawberries of my eye"?
              I think an answer could be, because God chose Apple. 
            The word apple comes from the latin word pomum. which means fruit in general.
             Then known as pome because of it's tiny seeds. Before Christianity became the mainstream religion of the roman empire, 
             apple was malum in latin which means melon.However after Christianity became the dominate religion, Apple became the Fruit of the fruit.
              Mainly because of the story of Adams and Eves. 
              Nobody know why the fruit Adam was tempted with wasn't a kiwi. 
              Why the gardan of Eden didn't grow pears. The tree of knowledge simply grew apples.
              Therefore apples have a great significant in Christianity. 
            Another story that also came from Chirstianity about apples is Adam's apple.
             Adam's apple is referred to the lump on throat of men. The orgin of that word came from the same bible story of Adam and Eve.
              When Adam ate the foribidden apple, the punishment was it got stuck on in his throat, resulting in him having a lump.
               So from then on every men of his decendant would have an adam's apple. 
            The great saying, Apple of one's Eye was used in the bible itself.
             It's a idiom that means a person or thing that is greatly loved.
             Because the apple was the fruits of fruits, during the ancient times, people thought the pupil of one's eye was like an apple.
